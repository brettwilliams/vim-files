Personal vim files.  Pathogen/solarized based.  Bundles are not kept
using git submodules yet, just using a update_bundles.rb script that
I modified from Tammer Saleh (thanks!).

A few items I don't keep in sync.  Dr. Chip's align is ridiculously complex
now, I am just keeping the old version that I have been using for years.

I use snipMate a decent amount, and luckily the pathogen setup makes it easy to
add my own snippets in the normal directories so they don't have to be merged.
