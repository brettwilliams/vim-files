Personal vim files.  Pathogen/solarized based.  Bundles are not kept using git
submodules yet, just using a update_bundles.rb script that I modified from
Tammer Saleh (thanks!).

A few items I don't keep in sync.  Dr. Chip's align is ridiculously complex
now, I am just keeping the old version that I have been using for years.

I use snipMate a decent amount, and luckily the pathogen setup makes it easy to
add my own snippets in the normal directories so they don't have to be merged.
Solarized takes too much effort to keep up to date (I use mrxvt for which there
is no port and it doesn't support #define).  

Doxygen support I also have my own customizations.  I will probably stop using
it in favor of simpler snippets.
